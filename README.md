# File Share

## Goal

Quickly share files and messages between devices.

- Quickly -> Browser
- Share files -> WebRTC

## Todo

Limited by `peer.js`, we cannot impl these features:

- [ ] accurate send/recv progress
- [ ] handling control message prior to file data chunk
- [ ] improved memory usage
